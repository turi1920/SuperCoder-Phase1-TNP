-->Vehicles are of two types - "Two Wheeler" and "Four Wheeler Each vehicle is identified by vehicle id, type, cost and premium amount.
-->Premium amount is 2% of the vehicle cost for two wheelers and6% of the vehicle cost for four wheelers.
Calculate the premium amount and display the vehicle details. Write a Python program to implement the class chosen with its attributes and methods.
Note:
Consider all instance variables to be private and methods to be public
Include getter and setter methods for all instance variables) Display appropriate error message, if the vehicle type is  invalid

Perform case sensitive string comparison Represent few objects of the class, initialize instance variables using setter methods, invoke appropriate methods and test your program.
